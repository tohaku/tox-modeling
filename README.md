# Tox Modeling

This repository contains small RDKit-based utilities for exploring basic chemical reaction predictions.

- **metabolite_generator.py** iteratively applies simple metabolic reaction rules to a starting molecule and prints the resulting metabolites.
- **reaction_mapper.py** demonstrates applying named reaction SMARTS to reactants for educational purposes.
- **predict_metabolism_cli.py** provides a small command line interface for generating metabolites and tracing pathways.

RDKit must be installed for these scripts to run. The provided `requirements.txt` lists the dependency.
